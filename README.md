#OVERVIEW

A working group was established at Unallocated Space (unallocatedspace.org) for INFOSEC NIGHT to teach people to not depend on the wild swiss army knife called Kali Linux.

The idea was to teach students/participants to:
Use Bash
Understand Linux under the hood
Understand Linux Networking
Deploy Tools and Depande`ncies
OPSEC
PERSEC
Scripting and git

Version 1.0 will be made in BashScript
Version 2.0 will be made in Python
Version 3.0 ?
